## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. **Set Environment Variables**
```bash
# Add to your .env.local
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_project_url
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_key
```

### 2. **Install Dependencies & Run Migration**
```bash
# Install Supabase client
npm install @supabase/supabase-js tsx

# Test database connection
npm run db:test

# Migrate demo data
npm run db:migrate
```

### 3. **Update Your App Code**

Replace demo data imports with Supabase queries:
```typescript
// OLD: import { recipes } from './data/seed';
// NEW:
import { supabase } from './lib/supabase';
import type { Recipe } from './types/database';

const { data: recipes } = await supabase
  .from('recipes')
  .select('*, recipe_ingredients(*), recipe_steps(*)')
  .eq('is_published', true);
```

### 4. **Create Your First Users**

Option A - Via Supabase Dashboard:
1. Go to Authentication → Users
2. Add supervisor account (manually update role to 'supervisor')
3. Add test users

Option B - Via your app's auth flow (recommended)

### 5. **Test & Deploy**
1. Test all app features with the new database
2. Add real content to replace demo data
3. Set up production environment variables
4. Deploy your app
