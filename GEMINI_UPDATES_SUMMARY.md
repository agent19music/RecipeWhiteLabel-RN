# Gemini AI Recipe Generation Updates

## Summary of Changes Made to `utils/gemini.ts`

### ðŸ”„ Key Improvements

#### 1. **Structured Prompt System** (Inspired by `ai.ts`)
- **Before**: Simple string-based prompts
- **After**: Comprehensive system with base prompt + Royco-enhanced prompt generation
- **Benefits**: More consistent AI responses, better product integration

#### 2. **Royco Products Integration** (Using `royco-products.ts`)
- **Before**: Hardcoded product suggestions in `generateRoycoSuggestions()`
- **After**: Dynamic product suggestions using the comprehensive product catalog
- **New Functions Used**:
  - `suggestRoycoProducts()` - AI-powered product matching
  - `generateRoycoEnhancedPrompt()` - Context-aware prompt generation
  - `ensureRoycoProducts()` - Post-processing for guaranteed integration

#### 3. **Enhanced Recipe Structure**
- **Before**: Basic recipe object with limited fields
- **After**: Comprehensive recipe structure matching `ai.ts` standards
- **New Fields**:
  - `processingTime` - Performance tracking
  - `roycoEnhanced` - Clear branding flag
  - `sponsoredProducts` - Product placement tracking
  - `aiModel` - Model version tracking
  - Structured `details` object with timing, difficulty, equipment

#### 4. **Robust Error Handling**
- **Before**: Basic try-catch with simple fallbacks
- **After**: Multi-level fallback system with structured error recovery
- **Improvements**:
  - JSON parsing with markdown code block support
  - Intelligent fallback recipe generation
  - Catalog-based product suggestions on AI failure

#### 5. **Performance & Caching Preparation**
- Added timing measurements for optimization
- Structured for future caching implementation
- Better error tracking for debugging

### ðŸ“‹ Technical Changes

#### Modified Functions:

1. **`generateEnhancedRecipe()`**
   - Now uses `generateRoycoEnhancedPrompt()` for better prompts
   - Integrates `suggestRoycoProducts()` for intelligent product matching
   - Uses `ensureRoycoProducts()` for guaranteed integration
   - Returns structured recipe object with comprehensive metadata

2. **`generateRoycoSuggestions()`**
   - Now leverages the product catalog from `royco-products.ts`
   - Provides AI with specific available products
   - Fallback uses catalog-based suggestions instead of hardcoded ones

3. **Helper Functions**
   - Added `createFallbackRecipe()` for structured error handling
   - Added `getDefaultRoycoSuggestionsFromCatalog()` for catalog-based fallbacks
   - Removed unused helper functions to clean up codebase

#### New Imports:
```typescript
import { 
  suggestRoycoProducts, 
  generateRoycoEnhancedPrompt, 
  ensureRoycoProducts,
  type RoycoProduct 
} from './royco-products';
```

### ðŸŽ¯ Benefits of Updates

1. **Better Product Recommendations**: Uses comprehensive catalog instead of hardcoded suggestions
2. **Consistent Recipe Structure**: Matches the proven pattern from `ai.ts`
3. **Enhanced Error Recovery**: Multiple fallback levels ensure recipes are always generated
4. **Future-Proof Architecture**: Easy to extend with new Royco products
5. **Performance Tracking**: Built-in timing for optimization
6. **Better Debugging**: Comprehensive error handling and logging

### ðŸ§ª Testing

A test file has been created (`test-gemini-updates.ts`) to verify:
- âœ… Royco product suggestion accuracy
- âœ… Recipe generation with proper structure
- âœ… Product integration verification
- âœ… Error handling robustness

### ðŸ”® Future Enhancements

The updated structure now supports:
- Easy addition of new Royco products via `royco-products.ts`
- Caching implementation for performance
- A/B testing different prompt strategies
- Advanced analytics on product placement effectiveness
- Integration with recommendation engines

---

**Result**: The `generateEnhancedRecipe()` function now provides a more robust, scalable, and effective way to integrate Royco products into AI-generated recipes while maintaining the proven architectural patterns from `ai.ts`.
