    embedUrl: 'https://www.tiktok.com/embed/actual-video-id',
  },
  // ... rest of recipe
}
```

### Adding Photo Assets
1. Add photos to `/assets/images/community/` folder
2. Update image paths in community-recipes.ts:
```typescript
image: require('@/assets/images/community/ombachi-pilau.jpg'),
images: [
  require('@/assets/images/community/ombachi-pilau-1.jpg'),
  require('@/assets/images/community/ombachi-pilau-2.jpg'),
